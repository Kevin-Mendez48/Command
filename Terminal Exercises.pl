Terminal Exercises
Part 1:

1. To make a directory called 'first', we use the command 'mk dir' followed by the name you would like to use. In this case 'first'
2.  To change directory we use the command 'cd' and we will use 'first' as the chosen folder
3. To create a file we use the command 'touch' and name is 'person.txt'
4. To change the name of a file, we use the command 'mv' and the name of the first, plus the name it will be changed to. which would be 'person.txt another.txt'
5.To make a copy of a file we use the comand 'cp' and the file name 'another.txt', followed by the name to give the copy. In this case 'copy.txt'
6. To remove a file we use 'rm', and the name of the file 'copy.txt'
7. To copy a directory and name is something else, we use 'cp -r' followed by the name of the file and the copy. The -r makes a copy of all the contents, including subdirectories and all of their content.
8. To delete a copy, we use the same 'rm' command as proir, just with the '-r' flag to delete all of the subdirectories and all the content.

1. mkdir first
2. cd first
3. touch person.txt
4. mv person.txt another.txt
5. cp another.txt copy.txt
6. rm copy.txt
7. cp -r first second
8. rm -r second

Part 2:

1. The 'man' command would display an interfact to the system reference manuals. To exit one would press 'q'
2. The '-a' says 'do not ignore entries starting with', which means to not ignore any entries. it will dipslay everything starting with a dot.
The '-l' displays everything in a long listing format.
3. One can jump between words in the terminal by holding down alt with an arrow key.
4. The end of the terminal is reached by pressing Ctrl with 'e'
5. Pressing Ctrl with 'a' will move the cursor to the beginning of the line.
6. Pressuing Ctrl with 'w' will delete an entire word.
7. The terminal is where you use text to interact with a computer. The shell is where one enters commands which is interpreted by the computer. The terminal window is how one interacts with the shell.
8. An absolute path is the entirety of the file/directory up until the root.
9. A relative path will have a few dots in place of 'parent' directories, only showing the current location
10. A flag is used to modify a command. for example, earlier we used -r for the 'rm' command, which makes it delete all subdirectories not just the current.
11. The 'r' that has been used before stands for 'recursive'. The '-f' flag will suppress most error messages.
